By following this approach, we ensure that our development efforts are organized, focused, and aligned with the core objectives of Apex Estates. Each sprint builds upon the previous one, incrementally enhancing the platform's functionality and delivering tangible value to our users.

### The Structure Plane

We meticulously outline the architectural framework and navigation flow of our website to ensure a seamless user experience. The site follows a modern MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, with a robust front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. Our back-end leverages Django, a powerful Python framework, to handle data management, user authentication, and CRUD operations for property listings. Navigation throughout the site is intuitive, with a hierarchical structure starting from the engaging landing page, guiding users to explore property listings, view their personalized dashboard, and access essential pages like the About Us and Contact Us sections.
