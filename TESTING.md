## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

For our HTML Validation, we relied on the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). This invaluable tool enabled us to meticulously assess every aspect of our HTML code against the official standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Through this validation process, we ensured that our web pages adhere to the best practices of HTML syntax, structure, and semantics.

During our validation process, our pages underwent rigorous scrutiny, resulting in the identification of a few errors, all of which were promptly rectified. Each issue was addressed immediately, followed by a thorough retesting to ensure a seamless pass. However, it's worth noting that some non-critical errors associated with Summernote persisted, which unfortunately remain beyond our control. Despite this, we have strived to uphold the highest standards of quality assurance, guaranteeing an optimal browsing experience for our users.
